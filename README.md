# Doctor Segmentation Project 

This is a small project where I tried to segment doctors based on their prescription data using RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary).

I used a sample dataset to score each doctor and classify them into different groups like high-value, regular, and inactive. This helps in planning better marketing strategies.

I’ve used Python with pandas and matplotlib for this project.  
Simple visualizations like pie charts are also added.
